            <h2>Life Story</h2>
            <p>Albert Kenrick Fisher was born in Ossining (formerly Sing Sing), New York and grew up on a hillside above the tidal flats of the Hudson River.
              His childhood was undoubtedly filled with adventures in the countryside surrounding his home and the marshes of Croton Point where he would have gained
              extensive personal experience in Natural History. After obtaining his early education at Dr. Holbrook's Military School he went on to study at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of New York, and graduated in 1879 with medical training. <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/%28King1893NYC%29_pg280_COLLEGE_OF_PHYSICIANS_AND_SURGEONS%2C_437_WEST_59TH_STREET.jpg/320px-%28King1893NYC%29_pg280_COLLEGE_OF_PHYSICIANS_AND_SURGEONS%2C_437_WEST_59TH_STREET.jpg" alt="">
